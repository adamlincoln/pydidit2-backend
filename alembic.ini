# A generic, single database configuration.

[alembic]
# path_separator; This indicates what character is used to split lists of file
# paths, including version_locations and prepend_sys_path within configparser
# files such as alembic.ini.
# The default rendered in new alembic.ini files is "os", which uses os.pathsep
# to provide os-dependent path splitting.
#
# Note that in order to support legacy alembic.ini files, this default does NOT
# take place if path_separator is not present in alembic.ini.  If this
# option is omitted entirely, fallback logic is as follows:
#
# 1. Parsing of the version_locations option falls back to using the legacy
#    "version_path_separator" key, which if absent then falls back to the legacy
#    behavior of splitting on spaces and/or commas.
# 2. Parsing of the prepend_sys_path option falls back to the legacy
#    behavior of splitting on spaces, commas, or colons.
#
# Valid values for path_separator are:
#
# path_separator = :
# path_separator = ;
# path_separator = space
# path_separator = newline
#
# Use os.pathsep. Default configuration used for new projects.
path_separator = os

# set to 'true' to search source files recursively
# in each "version_locations" directory
# new in Alembic version 1.10
# recursive_version_locations = false

# database URL.  This is consumed by the user-maintained env.py script only.
# other means of configuring database URLs may be customized within the env.py
# file.
